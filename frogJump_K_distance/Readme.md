Frog jump with K distances


A frog wants to climb a staircase with n steps. Given an integer array heights, where heights[i] contains the height of the ith step, and an integer k.
To jump from the ith step to the jth step, the frog requires abs(heights[i] - heights[j]) energy, where abs() denotes the absolute difference. The frog can jump from the ith step to any step in the range [i + 1, i + k], provided it exists
Return the minimum amount of energy required by the frog to go from the 0th step to the (n-1)th step.


Example 1
Input: heights = [10, 5, 20, 0, 15], k = 2

Output: 15
Explanation:
0th step -> 2nd step, cost = abs(10 - 20) = 10
2nd step -> 4th step, cost = abs(20 - 15) = 5
Total cost = 10 + 5 = 15.


Example 2
Input: heights = [15, 4, 1, 14, 15], k = 3

Output: 2
Explanation:
0th step -> 3rd step, cost = abs(15 - 14) = 1
3rd step -> 4th step, cost = abs(14 - 15) = 1
Total cost = 1 + 1 = 2.
